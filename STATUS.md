## Needs Improvement

- [x] ~~**No frontend tests**~~ — 97 Vitest tests across 10 pages (biofeedback, calibration, dashboard, emotion-lab, research-hub, daily-brain-report, ai-companion, sleep-session, onboarding, research-enroll) — 16 of those are Daily Brain Report tests
- [ ] **Untested hardware integration** — BrainFlow Muse 2 connection not tested end-to-end
- [ ] **Train remaining 15 models** — Only emotion classifier has formal training pipeline. Others use heuristic fallbacks
- [x] ~~**97.79% LGBM model**~~ — Deleted (inflated score, per-dataset PCA + within-subject contamination). Replaced by mega LGBM 74.21% CV
- [x] ~~**Baseline calibration has no frontend UX**~~ — `/onboarding` fullscreen 3-phase guided calibration screen built; dashboard banner shows until BaselineCalibrator is ready; sidebar "Connect Device" links to `/device-setup` which routes to `/onboarding`
- [x] ~~**Device pairing UX missing**~~ — Device pairing wizard wired: Connect Device in sidebar → `/device-setup` banner → `/onboarding`
- [ ] **Food-emotion module needs validation data** — 6 states are scientifically grounded but no pilot study has been run to measure real accuracy

### Phase 4 — Growth 🔄 IN PROGRESS
- [x] Weekly brain summary card — 7-day avg stress/focus/sleep with copy button (on `/brain-report`)

- [x] Per-user model fine-tuning trigger — after every 5 corrections for a user, POST batch to ML backend online learner (`PersonalModelAdapter.adapt()`)
- [ ] Export data (CSV, Apple Health sync)

## Food-Emotion Research Roadmap

This is the novel publishable contribution. No prior paper maps real-time consumer EEG to food/eating states.

- [ ] **IRB ethics approval** (4–8 weeks) — required for human subjects research
- [ ] **Controlled pilot study** (4–6 weeks post-IRB) — 20–30 participants, food cue presentation protocol
- [ ] **Cross-subject validation** — LOSO cross-validation, target >65% 6-class with calibration
- [x] **DREAMER dataset** — downloaded and integrated into cross-dataset training pipeline
- [x] **FACED dataset** — 123 subjects, integrated, 63.31% CV (3-class positive/neutral/negative)
- [ ] **Write paper** — IEEE TAFFC or Frontiers in Neuroscience
- [ ] **Open-source release** — GitHub tag, HuggingFace model weights, anonymized pilot data

## Future Plans

- [x] ~~Add Vitest for frontend component + integration tests~~ — 97 tests across 10 pages shipped
- [ ] Expand test coverage to remaining 15 pages
- [ ] Train all 17 models on real datasets with published benchmarks
- [ ] Mobile-optimized layout / React Native companion app
- [ ] Multi-user session support (currently single-user per server instance)
- [ ] Docker Compose setup for one-command deployment (frontend + backend + DB)
- [ ] Real-time collaborative sessions (shared brain data viewing)
